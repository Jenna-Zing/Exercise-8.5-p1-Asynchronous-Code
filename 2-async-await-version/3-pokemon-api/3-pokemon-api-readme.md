Each step in #3 - pokemon api, will be broken into its own subfolder. I recommend for each of these, reviewing the console.logs + checking the Network tab in the Browser > Inspect.

1. step_1 -> can view in VSCode HTML preview.
2. step_2 -> to see the console.log of the 3 selected pokemon data, you must open it in the Browser, Inspect > Console.
3. step_3 -> to see the console.log of the 3 selected pokemon data, you must open it in the Browser, Inspect > Console.
4. step_4 -> to see the console.log of the 3 selected pokemon data, you must open it in the Browser, Inspect > Console.
