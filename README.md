## Running the Project

To run the project locally:

1. run `npm install -g http-server` (if not installed already)
2. in your project folder and navigate to desired subproject (e.g. 1-numbers-api), run: `http-server`. Alternatively, run `http-server -c-1` so there's no cache, and you can refresh as normal.
3. Open your browser and go to any of the available links when running `http-server` -> e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. Make sure to right click on the refresh button and select "clear cache and hard refresh". It appears to have a cache for 3600 seconds, which we need to bypass when making changes to see it live.

   - Alt Recommended: Or use VSCode HTML Preview!
